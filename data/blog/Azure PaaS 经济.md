## 什么是 Azure PaaS

Azure PaaS 主要是由Azure应用服务组成，包括 App Service, Spring Apps, Logic Apps, Azure Function, Azure API Management, Azure Application Gateway 。 

Microsoft Azure services like Azure App Service,Azure Spring Apps, Azure Logic Apps, Azure Functions, and Azure API Management provide customers with a fully managed application platform as a service (PaaS) for building, deploying, and
managing applications of all kinds — from the simplest website to the most complex business solution.


## Azure PaaS给客户带来的收益

### 经过客户证实的收益

Quantified benefits. Three-year, risk-adjusted present value (PV) quantified benefits for the composite organization include:
- 降低研发资源成本：定价方案上提供多种Plan，匹配不同的场景（测试、生产、高性能、安全隔离），成本最优（在Basic等测试环境启用利旧IaaS资源）。Reduced application-development-related infrastructure costs by 40%. The composite organization reduces the infrastructure used for application development over time. It has a multiyear migration plan, and it stages retirements after ensuring migrated applications are fully up and running in the Azure PaaS environment. This saves the composite
organization more than $19.1 million over three years.
- 降低运维管理成本：操作系统、语言虚拟机、应用服务器自动打补丁。Reduced related administration costs. Azure PaaS does not require as many resources as onpremises or IaaS implementations on an ongoing basis. Microsoft handles virtually all server administration tasks (e.g., OS, language
patching) in the cloud, which reduces the administrative burden on the composite organization so it can focus on more productive activities. This saves the composite organization $10.3 million over three years.
- 提升开发运维效率：内置现代化应用运行环境，包括函数、微服务等不同构型应用所需的运行时组件，支持自动弹性伸缩等。Improved development efficiencies. The Azure PaaS platform and access to related Azure DevOps services enable the composite’s developers to work much more efficiently, saving the organization $7.2 million over three years. Because Azure PaaS provides a more structured environment for modernizing applications, developers spend more time on value-added
activities.
- 提升应用运行稳定性。Improved application uptime. The composite organization perceives Azure PaaS as a more resilient platform than on-premises platforms, and developers leverage cloud-native patterns to ensure greater resiliency for their applications. The improvement in application uptime saves the composite organization $3.8 million in avoided revenue losses over three years.
- 提升应用交付速度：被DevOps集成。Faster application and feature development. After deploying to Azure PaaS, the composite’s developers work in an integrated DevOps environment. The composite organization increases the speed of application development to production and improvement cycles by 50%, enabling its business to serve customers better. The improved time to market saves $2.8 million
over three years.
